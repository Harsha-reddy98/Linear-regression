# Linear-regression


Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. 
In the article “Beauty in the Classroom: Professors’ Pulchritude and Putative Pedagogical Productivity” (PDF), authors Daniel Hamermesh and Amy M. Parker suggest 
(based on a data set of teaching evaluation scores collected at UT Austin) that student evaluation scores can partially be predicted by features unrelated to 
teaching, such as the physical attractiveness of the instructor.

In this notebook, we will use this data to try and predict the average instructor rating with a multiple linear regression.

Data:

The data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six students looked at a photograph of each professor in the sample, and rated the professors’ physical appearance. More specifically:

Each of the professors’ pictures was rated by each of six undergraduate students: Three women and three men, with one of each gender being a lower-division, two upper-division students (to accord with the distribution of classes across the two levels). The raters were told to use a 10 (highest) to 1 rating scale, to concentrate on the physiognomy of the professor in the picture, to make their ratings independent of age, and to keep 5 in mind as an average.

We are using a slightly modified version of the original data set from the published paper. The dataset was released along with the textbook “Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models” (Gelman and Hill, 2007).)
